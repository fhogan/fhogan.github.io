My primary research objective is to enable reactive robotic manipulation. The ability to perceive the environment and react to unanticipated events is of paramount importance to deploy robots that are to interact with the physical world, which is difficult to observe and predict. Whereas humans effectively process and react to sensing information, robot manipulation skills are most often programmed in an open- loop fashion, incapable of correcting their motion based on detected errors.
My research aims to enable robots skilled at i) monitoring the execution of a task, and ii) using sensed information in real-time for closed-loop control. Giving robots the ability to identify mistakes and correct their behavior in a timely fashion is essential for them to purposefully interact with their environment.

        We investigate investigates real-time control strategies 
        for dynamical systems that involve frictional contact interactions. 
        Hybridness and underactuation are key characteristics of these systems 
        that  complicate the design of feedback controllers.
  <p> Our results show that a Model Predictive Control approach used in tandem 
  with integer programming offers a powerful solution to capture the dynamic 
  constraints associated with the friction cone as well as the hybrid nature 
  of contact.

  <h3>
    Tactile regrasp: Grasp adjustments via simulated tactile transformations

        In this project, we develop tactile reflexes, giving robots the ability to make grasp adjustments immediately 
        upon making contact with an object. Tactile information is used to assess in real-time 
        the quality of a grasp and predict failures preemptively and to design a controller able to perform local grasp 
        adjustments, where grasp are improved directly upon making initial touch with an object.
