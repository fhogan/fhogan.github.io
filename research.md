    PhD Research:
  </h2>

  <p>
		I work on <strong>Inference</strong>, <strong>Modeling/Simulation</strong>,
		<strong>Control</strong>, and <strong>Learning</strong> applied to
		<strong>Robotic Manipulation</strong>.
		I am interested in the complex and exciting world of physical interactions,
		these interactions are fundamental to the utility of real-world agents. Physical
		interactions are complex because they are <strong>hybrid</strong>, which means
		that the dynamics of the robot change as it comes into contact and whether the
		type of contact is permitted to stick or slide. These interactions are also
		<strong>difficult to model</strong> because of the complex nature of frictional
		contact. Though contact is complex, it provides us with a wealth of information
		which we can use to make <strong>inferences</strong> about the world.
	</p>

  <p>
		I work on developing <strong>algorithms</strong> and
		<strong>models</strong> that allow robots to intelligently and autonomously
		interact and learn from their environment. I have worked on both
		<strong>model-based</strong> and <strong>machine learning</strong> approaches
		and believe there is a world in which we can combine our knowledge of physics
		and learning approaches to garner the best of both worlds.
